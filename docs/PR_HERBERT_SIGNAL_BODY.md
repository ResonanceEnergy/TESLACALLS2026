This PR adds **HERBERT‑SIGNAL**: an external intelligence feed that converts
public Herbert Ong content into **AL‑1 SignalEvents** + an enriched Catalyst
Calendar. Paper‑trade only, Council‑gated.

**What’s included**
- `signals/herbertong/` ingestion + mapping (scaffold)
- Offline samples → `samples/*`
- `ops/pipelines/calendar_update.py` → `research/Catalyst_Calendar_enriched.md`
- `docs/HERBERT_SIGNAL.md`
- Artifacts from dry‑run: `artifacts/arena6_first_dry_run_*`

**Governance**
- Public data only; preserve provenance; respect ToS.
- Council must approve any outward use; remains research‑only.
